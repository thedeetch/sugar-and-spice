Looking for a fun treat for your Halloween party? Or just a cutesy snack for your kids to celebrate Halloween? (Or let’s be honest – a treat just for you!) This is your winner right here – chocolate, cookies, and a cheesecake layer!

Remember the days when you could actually make homemade treats to bring to school on your birthday? Sigh. Well, since I have an October birthday, my mom always made “boo” cups for mine! It was such a fun treat, and it was a nice break from cupcakes and cookies.

I’ve upped the ante with this elevated version of them by adding a luscious no bake cheesecake layer. To be honest, I would recommend making these in a clear punch cup instead of the regular cup I used for the pictures. I had to use a full size cup because 1 – I thought I had punch cups but didn’t (of course) and 2 – the day I made them we had a snowstorm so a trip to the store with 2 kids was out of the question. If you do end up in the same boat I was, I recommend sharing because these are RICH. Incredibly delicious, but rich.
